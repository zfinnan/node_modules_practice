# Node Modules Practice

1. Fork and clone this repo
2. Initialize node in your cloned repo so it becomes a node project!

## Make your own module

* create a node module that stores an array of your favorite foods
* mport that module into your index.js
* write code in your index.js so when you run your app, it loops through the array, printing all of your favorite foods to the console

## Experiment with implementing a package

* Find a [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) that looks interesting
* Experiment with incorporating it into this node project, just like we did with moment

## Add to your Node app instructions readme

* add notes about how to create and import node modules to your Node/Express app readme, along with instructions about adding a `.gitignore`
* paste the link to your repo in this the readme of this assignment

## Finally, .gitignore and submit a PR!

* add a `.gitignore` to this assignment, so the `node_modules` folder doesn't upload to github
* Submit this assignment by making a pull request
